## Introduction

### Reproducible Research

It is likely that most of the work that you have done thus far for these tutorials have not been recorded in a lab notebook.  Reasons for this are manyfold but primary is the lack of a good tool.  Before getting into the nitty gritty of our favorite tool, R Notebooks, let's briefly discuss what is needed to reproduce computational research.

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXSRP--d3Q4)

```{r reproducble-research-quiz}
question("What do authors *not* need to share?",
  answer("Data"),
  answer("Code"),
  answer("Computers", correct=TRUE),
  answer("Documentation"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Why R Notebooks? (1/2)

An R Notebook is a way to use R to easily create clean reports that **combine R code and output with explanations and comments**.  They are convenient for creating:

+ **Digital "lab notebooks"** for yourself, recording the day's work - what code you used and why, what the results were.
+ **Sharable data analysis documents**, for collaborating with other data scientists.
+ **Reports** for colleagues, collaborators, supervisors, etc.

Here are links to a couple of example R Notebooks, so you can see them in action:

+ [Explore SingleCellExperiment using tidyverse](http://www.c-moor.org/rnotebooks/retina.nb.html){target="_blank"}
+ [Process pbmc3k using Bioconductor OSCA](http://www.c-moor.org/rnotebooks/osca-pbmc3k.nb.html){target="_blank"}
+ [RNA velocity using Bioconductor](http://www.c-moor.org/rnotebooks/velocity.nb.html){target="_blank"}
+ [Explore marianes-regions using DESeq2](http://www.c-moor.org/rnotebooks/marianes-regions.nb.html){target="_blank"}

### Why R Notebooks? (2/2)

Watch the following video, introducing some of the great features of R Notebooks: 

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTDd5VP9V10)

```{r why-r-notebooks-quiz}
question("What is *not* a feature of R Notebooks?",
  answer("Organizes code with the corresponding results and prose"),
  answer("Facilitates cycles of editing code and viewing results"),
  answer("Guarantees that analyses are inerrant", correct=TRUE),
  answer("Creates a self-contained .html report that can be easily shared"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### RStudio Server

For this tutorial, you will work on a centralized [RStudio Server](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-server){target="_blank"} so that you do **not** have to install R or RStudio.  To get you started as quickly as possible, use one of the following:

- [SciServer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eXaBhhVz7AVe0A2QZFP8EMCOQh-qPgOUeuajZkZsPrI){target="_blank"} -- for C-MOOR students
- [MyBinder](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/c-moor/rstudio-binder/master?urlpath=rstudio){target="_blank"} -- we've configured this for anyone to use
- Institutional Resource -- ask your local informatics group if this is an option
- [RStudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free){target="_blank"} -- try for free, pay for more
- [AnVIL](https://jhudatascience.org/AnVIL_Book_Getting_Started/tools.html){target="_blank"} -- NHGRI's Genomic Data Science Analysis, Visualization, and Informatics Lab-Space

A centralized RStudio Server provides the following advantages:

- Software -- many of the commonly used software packages are pre-installed
- Data -- datasets generated by the sequencing core or other lab members are readily accessible
- Compute -- access to more CPU, memory, and disk space than is available on a typical laptop
- Server -- long running computations run on the server rather than your laptop (even if you lose internet connection)

Before continuing with this tutorial, please ensure that you are able to log into an RStudio Server instance

```{r question-11}
question("Are you able to log into RStudio Server (and see something *similar* to the screenshot below)?",
  answer("No"),
  answer("Yes", correct=TRUE),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

## 1. First R Notebook

### Anatomy of an R Notebook

Read [Anatomy of an R Notebook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pg78Jvh6frO-Um1JWSo1GkQhcIYU730HBnwzlzNxb34){target="_blank"} to learn about the components of an R Notebook and how they fit together.

```{r anatomy-of-an-r-notebooks-quiz}
question("Generally, where does code go and where does prose go?",
  answer("Code goes in the `.Rmd`, prose goes in the `.nb.html`"),
  answer("Code goes in the YAML, prose goes in the body"),
  answer("Code goes in the grey background, prose goes in the white background", correct=TRUE),
  answer("Code goes in the white background, prose goes in the grey background"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Video: R Notebook Workflow

This is a basic workflow for working with R Notebooks:

1. **Create a new R Notebook** (or open an existing one)
2. **Insert a code chunk** (add and run code)
3. **Add narrative** (notes, explanations, conclusions)
4. **Preview output report** (edit until you're happy)
5. **Repeat steps 2-4** (adding code and narrative and Previewing until you're done)
6. **Share R Notebook**

The following video demonstrates these steps in action.

### Assignment: my_first_r_notebook.Rmd (1/2)

Now it's your turn!  Create an R Notebook to explore the `Puromycin` dataset that is included as part of base R (more detailed instructions are below).  This is a fairly simple dataset that gives the reaction rates of galactosyltransferase at different substrate concentrations, with and without treatment with puromycin:

```{r}
Puromycin
```

### Assignment: my_first_r_notebook.Rmd (2/2)

Your R Notebook will accomplish two goals:

+ Print out the `Puromycin` dataset
+ Plot substrate concentration vs. reaction velocity (as you would for Michaelis-Menten kinetics, though we won't do the calculations)

Now get to work!  Inside RStudio:

1. Create a new R Notebook
    + File > New File > R Notebook
    + Save it with an informative title
    + Delete the example code (everything below the three dashes (`---`) on line 4)
        + You can leave it for now if it's helpful, but there's no need to keep it 
2. Insert a code chunk
    + Insert a new code chunk (Insert > R)
    + In your new code chunk type `Puromycin` to print out the dataset
    + Run the code chunk (click the play button at the top of the code chunk)
        + You should see the data show up below the code chunk
3. Add narrative
    + In the white space above the code chunk, add a description of the dataset, e.g. "Galactosyltransferase reaction rates at different substrate concentrations, with and without treatment with puromycin"
4. Preview output report
    + Click either the Preview or the Save button
    + The output will probably pop up in a new tab or window - you may need to give it permission
    + In the output, you should see:
        + Your Title
        + Your description
        + A grey box with the code `Puromycin`
        + A printout of the dataset
5. Repeat steps 2-4 to add a plot
    + Insert a new code chunk (Insert > R)
    + In your new code chunk type `plot(Puromycin$conc, Puromycin$rate, col=Puromycin$state)` to plot substrate concentration vs. rate, colored by whether or not the sample was treated with puromycin
        + This is using base R plotting rather than ggplot2 - we will discuss how to load packages such as `ggplot2` into an R Notebook in the next section
    + Run the code chunk (click the play button at the top of the code chunk)
    + Click either the Preview or the Save button
    + In the output, you should see:
        + Your Title
        + Your description
        + A grey box with the code `Puromycin`
        + A printout of the dataset
        + Another grey box with the plotting code
        + The plot

## 2. Loading Packages

### Reading: R Notebook Workflow

Read [Basic R Notebook Workflow](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Akr9hlPE6LpNcyNCpVSTSAol2zr9ugG5-q6In1yCjg){target="_blank"} which covers each of these steps in more detail.

### Assignment: R Notebook with Packages (1/2)

Create your own R Notebook and use it to plot the `mpg` dataset with `ggplot2`.

Note that to work with `ggplot2` (or any package that is not included in base R) you will need to run the `library()` command to make the package available for your R Notebook. `library()` commands can be placed in code chunks just like any other R code.  It's generally a good idea to put `library()` commands at the top of your R Notebook  so you can easily see what packages are needed for the Notebook.

Here is a refresher video, demonstrating the steps for this assignment (including `library(ggplot2)`) .  It also shows a bit of *R Markdown* (adding headers and lists), which we will cover in the next section.

![](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gfzg-9K2r8)

### Assignment: R Notebook with Packages (2/2)

Here is a  `ggplot2` command to get you started:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = class))
```

Now, get to work!  Inside RStudio:

1. Create a new R Notebook
    + File > New File > R Notebook
    + Save it with an informative title
    + Delete the example code
    + Click Preview (adjust your settings so it appears in the browser or view pane, whichever you prefer)
2. Insert a code chunk (add and run code)
    + Insert a new code chunk (Insert > R)
    + In your new code chunk, attach the ggplot2 package (using the command `library( "ggplot2" )`)
    + Run the code chunk
    + Insert a new code chunk (Insert > R)
    + Copy the ggplot code above (plotting the mpg dataset) into your new code chunk
    + Run the code chunk
3. Add narrative (notes, explanations, conclusions)
    + Add prose in "white section" commenting on what you plotted.
4. Preview output report
    + If there's anything you'd like to change, edit the R Markdown file and then Preview again
5. Repeat steps 2-4 (adding code and narrative and Previewing until you're done)
    + Add another code chunk, and set color equal to a different variable from `mpg`
    + Add prose
    + Preview
6. Share R Notebook
    + Hold off on sharing for now, since you'll be adding to this R Notebook in the next section

## 3. Stylized Reports

### R Markdown

Now that you've got the basics of R Notebooks down, it's time to learn a bit of R Markdown so you can organize and style your R Notebook to produce more readable reports.

Read [R Markdown Basics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsy1tXpBjWof5Fv1FUaFLa6-D-7TL2tfu4dweIjnm7k){target="_blank"} to learn how to

+ Add section headers
+ Format text (**bold**, *italics*, `code`)
+ Create numbered and bulleted lists

In the next section you will add some R Markdown to the R Notebook you just created.

```{r r-markdown-quiz}
question("How do you make text appear `like code`?",
  answer("Surround it with single asterisks (`*`)"),
  answer("Surround it with double asterisks (`**`)"),
  answer("Surround it with backticks (`\``)", correct=TRUE),
  answer("Prefix it with a hash symbol (`#`)"),
  allow_retry = TRUE
)
```

### Assignment: Add R Markdown to an R Notebook

Go back to the R Notebook you created plotting the `mpg` dataset with ggplot.

1. At the top of the document (just under the `---` that marks the end of the YAML header) add a short statement about the purpose of the notebook (e.g. "Practicing plotting with ggplot2")
    + Bonus points if you style the word "ggplot2" as `code`
2. Add a *Heading 2* section header "Attach packages" above the code chunk that runs `library(ggplot2)`
3. Add a *Heading 2* section header (e.g. "Exploring the mpg dataset with ggplot2") above your plots.
4. Add an explanation of what you're working on in this section.  Let's include a bulleted list of the data you plotted. For example:
    + `mpg` is a dataset about cars from the `ggplot2` package
        + `displ`: engine displacement, in litres
        + `hwy`: highway miles per gallon
        + `class`: "type" of car
5. Run and Preview your document.  Did your headers, lists, and text styling come out correctly?
6. Continue cleaning up and organizing your R Notebook as much as you would like - for example, explain what variables you're plotting and why, or explain something about the ggplot code.  Is it showing what you want to show your audience - in this case, the future you who wants to remember how to use `ggplot`? ;)
7. Share your finished document
    + Upload your `.nb.html` file to Discourse or Slack
