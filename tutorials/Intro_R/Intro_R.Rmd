## Why R?

### Why R?

```{r question-5}
question("What is *not* a good reason to use R",
  answer("It's easier to share your work and for others to make suggestions"),
  answer("People all over the world create free analysis packages"),
  answer("The data visualization and graphics packages are rich and mature"),
  answer("It's the only way to analyze data", correct=TRUE),

)
```

## R as a calculator

### Your first R code

At a basic level, R is just a calculator.  Type `5+5` into the box below, then click the "Run Code" button (at the top right of the box).  You should see the number 10 printed below the box.  If you see an error message, check for typos in the code box.

```{r adding-exercise, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines=3}
```

R can do many mathematical operations.  Some examples include:

* Addition: `5+5`
* Subtraction: `5-3`
* Multiplication: `2*3`
* Division: `4/2`
* Raising to a power: `2**3` or `2^3`
* Taking a log: `log(5)`
    + By default R takes the natural log.  You can change this by adding a comma and your preferred base.  For example `log(5, 10)` find the log of 5 using base 10.
    + Since log10 is so popular, R has a special command: `log10(5)` will also find the log of 5 using base 10.  Note that this format only works for a couple of special, commonly used numbers (`log10`, `log2`).

### Many calculations at once

R will let you do many calculations in a row.  If I type `5+5` on the first line, and then type `log(7)` on the second line, R will print out both answers below the code box.  The result of each R command is printed in a separate white box:

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
5+5
log(7)
```

```{r}
5+5
log(7)
```

Use the box below to play around with R as a calculator.  Every time you click the "Run Code" button it will remove the results from last time and then print the results of *every* line that is currently in the code box.  Try entering at least two R commands and see how the results print out.

```{r calculator-exercise, exercise=TRUE}
```

## Storing data in R

R lets you store information by giving it a name.  We use the "arrow" or "assignment" operator to assign data to a name.  These names are usually called "variables".  The arrow points in the direction we want to store information - in this example, we want to store the number `24` in a variable named `favorite_number`.

```{r, echo=TRUE}
favorite_number <- 24
```

You can use almost any variable name you want, although there are a few rules:

* It can only contain letters, numbers, and underscores, and can't contain spaces (like an e-mail address)
* It has to start with a letter
* It's usually a good idea (though not required) to use a descriptive name (like `my_height`), rather than a generic name (like `x`), so it's easy to remember what the variable stands for.

### View stored data

When you store a variable, R won't print anything.  If you want to see what's inside a variable, type its name.  Notice that even though we have two R commands here, we only see one white output box.  That's because the first command (storing the value) doesn't have any output:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
favorite_number <- 24
favorite_number
```

### Use stored data

You can do math with these stored variables.  You can also store the results of calculations in new variables.

Print the result of adding 5 to whatever number is stored in `favorite_number`:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
favorite_number + 5
```

Calculate the result of subtracting 4 from the number stored in favorite_number and store the result in a new variable named `another_cool_number`.  Remember, when you store information, R doesn't print the results:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
another_cool_number <- favorite_number - 4
```

You can view the result of the calculation that we stored with the previous command by typing the name of the new variable we just made:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
another_cool_number
```

What happened to our original value?

If we reprint the number stored in `favorite_number`. you can see that this number didn't change when we did math with it:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
favorite_number
```

### A practical example

Why might you store information in a variable?  One reason is because you want to use that information over and over again without having to look it up.

Let's say you want to convert people's height from inches to meters.  One inch = 0.0254 meters.  Instead of having to remember that number, you can create a variable, and then use it in all your calculations.

Let's say you have three people's heights that you'd like to convert to meters:

- 65 in.
- 72 in.
- 59 in.

We can create a variable to store the conversion factor, and then multiply each person's height by that variable to find their height in meters:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
in_to_m <- 0.0254

65 * in_to_m
72 * in_to_m
59 * in_to_m
```

It's a lot easier to remember "in_to_m" than it is to remember a number (0.254).  And if you come back and look at your R code a week later, it's a lot easier to tell what you were working on!

### Try it yourself

Use the box below to play around with storing values.

Remember that R doesn't print anything when you store information in a variable - if you want to see what's in the variable, type out the name of the variable on its own line.

**NOTE**: Every time you click the "Run Code" button it will remove the results from last time and then run every line in the current box.  This means it will "forget" whatever number you stored last time you clicked the button.  There are several ways to store information "long-term" when you are working in R, but these code boxes are not set up for that. 

```{r storing-exercise, exercise=TRUE}
```

## Vectors (lists of data)

One of the things that makes R better than a standard calculator is that it can perform operations on whole lists of numbers.  In R these lists of numbers are called vectors.

We can create a vector using the `c` command (short for "combine"):

```{r, echo=TRUE}
my_vector <- c(1, 6, 13, 7, 2)
```

We can then do math on this whole list.  Multiplying our vector by 2 multiplies each number in the vector by 2:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
my_vector * 2
```

We can also mathematically combine two (or more) vectors.  If you add two vectors together, the first number of each vector get added together, then the second numbers get added together, and so on:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
vector1 <- c( 1, 3, 5)
vector2 <- c(1,1,1)
vector1 + vector2
```

Finally, there are several functions that can carry out calculations about the vector as a whole.  Some examples include:

* `sum(my_vector)`
* `mean(my_vector)`
* `median(my_vector)`
* `length(my_vector)` tells you how many numbers are in the vector

The `summary` function is a convenient way to calculate several of these summary statistics all at once:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
my_vector <- c(1, 6, 13, 7, 2)
summary(my_vector)
```

### A practical application

You can imagine many ways these vector function could be useful for data analysis.  One example is converting between units, if your data is not in the format you want.

Think back to our problem of converting inches to meters.  What if instead of 3 people's heights, you had a million people's heights (perhaps you're analyzing health data collected from different countries)?  You would not want to type a million R commands!  With vectors, you can type one R command and get the results for all 1,000,000 people.

Use the box below to convert the vector of heights in inches to a vector of heights in meters.  One inch = 0.0254 meters.  The first line of the code is giving you a vector of heights in inches  (only 10 people, phew).  You do not need to edit this line, but add some code beneath it to convert these numbers to meters.  If you accidentally delete the first line or want to start over, you can click the "Start Over" button at the top of the box.  If you need a hint, click the hint button at the top of the box.

```{r vector-exercise, exercise=TRUE}
inches <- c(65, 72, 59, 54, 63, 58, 69, 75, 65, 67)
```

```{r vector-exercise-hint-1}
"
Multiply the inches vector by 0.0254
You should get a vector that looks like this:
[1] 1.6510 1.8288 1.4986 1.3716 1.6002 1.4732 1.7526 1.9050 1.6510 1.7018
"
```

```{r vector-exercise-hint-2}
inches * 0.0254
```

## Dataframes (tables of data)

### R's specialty: Working with tables of data

R is very good at working with tables of data, the types of data you might typically store in a spreadsheet.  R has many functions for organizing the data, pulling out data matching particular qualities, and running calculations on the data.

R comes with some built-in practice datasets, we'll start by exploring the `iris` dataset, a famous dataset containing measurements of petals and sepals of 3 different species of iris.

We can print out the whole dataframe by typing its name:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
iris
```

This dataframe isn't too large, so it's fine to print out the whole thing, though it's still a little annoying to look through.  If you're working with data that has thousands or millions of rows though, it's nice to be able to print out or summarize only small pieces of the dataframe.  Here are some functions for working with dataframes:

* `head(dataframe)` prints out the first few lines of the dataframe
    + By default this will print 6 lines.  If you want to print out a different number, you can adjust the command by adding a comma, then the number of lines you want to print: `head(iris, 10)` will print the first 10 lines of the `iris` dataframe.
* `tail(dataframe)` prints out the last few lines
* `dim(dataframe)` tells you how many rows and columns the dataframe has
* `summary(dataframe)` prints out some useful summary statistics, such as the min, mean, median, and max for each numeric column of the dataframe
* `dataframe$column` lets you pick out a particular column by name
    + Example: `iris$Petal.Length`
* `filter(dataframe, condition)` lets you pick out particular rows that match a condition or set of conditions
    + For numerical values, this includes
        + `<` less than
        + `<=` less than or equal to
        + `==` exactly equal to
            + Note that we need two equal signs in a row to mean “exactly equal”
        + `>=` greater than or equal to
        + `>` greater than
        + Example: `filter(iris, Petal.Length >=1.5)` would pick out all rows (flowers) with an Petal Length of greater than or equal to 1.5
    + For non-numeric values, you can look for exact matches:
        + `filter(iris, species=="virginica")` would pick out all rows (flowers) with the species virginica
    + You can find partial matches using `str_detect`:
        + `filter(iris, str_detect(species, "ic"))` would pick out all rows (flowers) with a species name containing "ic" - in this case it would pick out both vers**ic**color and virgin**ic**a, but not setosa.
    + You can combine multiple condition using the `&` symbol:
        + `filter(iris, species=="virginica" & Petal.Length >=1.5)` would pick out all virginica species with Petal Length greater than 1.5

* You can store the results in new variables.  This can be extremely useful if you just want to work with some of the data:
    + `petal_length <- iris$Petal.Length`
    + `virginica_data <- filter(iris, species=="virginica"")`
    + `big_petals <- filter(iris, Petal.Length >=1.5)`
    + `big_virginica <- filter(iris, species=="virginica" & Petal.Length >=1.5)`

Use the code block below to explore the built-in `mtcars` dataframe, which contains several pieces of data about car design and performance (originally from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine).

```{r dataframe-exercise, exercise=TRUE}

```

```{r dataframe-exercise-hint-1}
"
Try using the dim() command to print out the dimensions of the dataframe
"
```

```{r dataframe-exercise-hint-2}
dim(mtcars)
```

```{r dataframe-exercise-hint-3}
"
Use the dataframe$column command to get the mpg column
"
```

```{r dataframe-exercise-hint-4}
mtcars$mpg
```

```{r dataframe-exercise-hint-5}
"
You can use the mean or summary commands to calculate the mean of a vector
"
```

```{r dataframe-exercise-hint-6}
"
mean(mtcars$mpg)
"
```

```{r dataframe-exercise-hint-7}
"
Use the filter command to find all rows where hp is less than 110
"
```

```{r dataframe-exercise-hint-8}
"
filter(mtcars, hp<110)
"
```

```{r dataframe-exercise-hint-9}
"
Again use the filter command.  Remember that you need to use the double equal sign to check for equality
"
```

```{r dataframe-exercise-hint-10}
"
filter(mtcars, cyl==110)
"
```


```{r explore-mtcars-quiz, echo=FALSE}
quiz(caption = "Explore the `mtcars` dataframe",
  question("How many cars are in this dataset?  How many features were examined for each car?",
    answer("32 cars, 11 features", correct = TRUE),
    answer("11 cars, 32 features"),
    answer("10 cars, 9 features"),
    answer("9 cars, 10 features"),
    allow_retry=TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
   ),
  question("What is the mean mpg for this set of cars?",
    answer("19.2"),
    answer("20.37"),
    answer("20.09", correct = TRUE),
    allow_retry=TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
   ),
  question("How many cars have a horsepower (the `hp` column) of less than 110?",
    answer("14"),
    answer("11", correct = TRUE),
    answer("18"),
    answer("10"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
   ),
  question("How many cars have exactly 4 cylinders (the `cyl` column)?",
    answer("3"),
    answer("11", correct = TRUE),
    answer("10"),
    allow_retry = TRUE,
    random_answer_order = TRUE
   )
)
```

## Plotting in R

One of the things that gets people excited about R is the ability to quickly plot data.  R tries to make it very easy to generate basic plots.

For example, if we want to plot Petal.Length vs. Petal.Width from the `iris` dataset, we can pull out those variables using `$` and then use the `plot(x,y)` command:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
p_length <- iris$Petal.Length
p_width <- iris$Petal.Width
plot(p_length, p_width)
```


It can sometimes be convenient to combine commands.  We can achieve the same plot using the following command:

```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width)
```

The one-line command produces the same plot as our original 3 line code.  The commands inside the parentheses are run first (just like in math).  Unlike the previous set of commands, this command does not save petal length and petal width as new vectors.  It's up to you whether you think this is more convenient, or you'd rather do things one at a time.


We can customize the plot by adding some addition information to the plot command:
```{r, echo=TRUE}
plot( iris$Petal.Length, iris$Petal.Width, main="Iris Petal Length vs. Petal Width", xlab = "Petal Length", ylab="Petal Width")
```

* `main` controls the main title of the plot
* `xlab` and `ylab` control the lables of the x and y axes

Use the code block below to plot some of the `mtcars` data.  Try plotting mpg (`mpg`) vs. weight (`wt`).  Make sure to label the plot.  When you have a plot you're happy with, take a screenshot.

```{r plotting-exercise, exercise=TRUE}
```

## Wrap-up

### Summary

1. R is like a fancy calculator, with special features that let you easily work with lists and tables of values, rather than one value at a time.
1. In R, we can use *vectors* to work with lists of values
1. In R, we can use *data.frames* to work with tables of values (like spreadsheets)
1. R is very good at making all sorts of plots.
